# full-stack-open

This repository contains my solutions to the [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com) course by the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/faculty-science/faculty/computer-science) at the University of Helsinki.


This course serves as an introduction to modern web application development with JavaScript. The main focus is on building single page applications with ReactJS that use REST APIs built with Node.js. The course also contains a section on GraphQL, a modern alternative to REST APIs.

The course covers testing, configuration and environment management, the use of databases for storing the applicationâ€™s data amongst other things.
